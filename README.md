# PartyBuddyBackend
Does that occur to you that sometimes you spotted a party nearby and want to get hyped together, but you don't know how to join? Do you want to reach out new people and attend the best local meetings/parties? These questions inspired our team to develop this IOS app that aims to help users host, request and attend parties.

To make this app, we split the task into front-end(Objective-C) and back-end (Java), and linked the whole app together with AWS and restful-web-service.

This is the backend repository for the newest hot IOS app PartyBuddy that helps you find parties nearby, request and get hyped in. All right reserved. Special thanks to maprequest, facebook, and IBM APIs and AWS.
